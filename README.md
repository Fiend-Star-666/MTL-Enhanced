# MTL-Enhanced
# Novel Chapter Fetcher

This project is a Java application that fetches and saves individual chapters of a novel from a specific website. It provides a web interface to specify the range of chapters to fetch and saves each chapter as a text file.

## Features

- Fetches chapters of a novel from a specific website.
- Allows users to specify the range of chapters to fetch using a web form.
- Saves each chapter as a text file in a designated directory.
- Uses Thymeleaf as the templating engine for the web interface.
- Uses Jsoup for HTML parsing.
- Supports HTTPS connections with custom trust stores.

## To Be Implemented 

- Linking ChatGpt apis or using LLMs so that it can translate the Novels or long texts of different languages into something coherent while keeping the context sane.
- Add swappable or auto fetch for the website structure.
  
Known Issues
The application assumes a specific website structure and may not work with different websites or novel sources.
Error handling and logging can be improved for better troubleshooting and debugging.
